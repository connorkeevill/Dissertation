This paper has already alluded to some resources necessary for a project of this nature.
Here, the required resources will be classified as hardware, software, or data.

\subsection{Hardware}\label{subsec:hardware}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Laptop: a MacBook - for research, system development, and dissertation writing;
	\item iPad Pro: for capture of RGB-D datasets;
	\item Microsoft Kinect v2: for capture of RGB-D datasets;
	\item Kinect adapter: Kinect uses a proprietary port, so an adapter is needed for anything other than an Xbox One;
	\item external drive: for storing datasets and backups;
	\item a GPU cluster: provided by the university - for running the developed systems and other existing 3D reconstruction systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software}\label{subsec:software}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Kinect SDK: for capturing data from Kinect;
	\item a C++ compiler (clang);
	\item a C++ IDE: CLion;
	\item KinectFusion: to provide a competitive baseline and basis for software development;
	\item Git/GitHub: project version control;
	\item VirtualBox: to allow Windows and Linux virtual machines to be ran - overcoming compatability issues with SDK;
	\item a \LaTeX\ editor: IntelliJ;
	\item an SSH client: to access GPU cluster;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data}\label{subsec:data}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bonn dynamic scene dataset, as showcased with ReFusion\cite{palazzolo2019iros}.
\end{itemize}
